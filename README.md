# fire_brigade_database

The database is of a fire brigade firm. It includes data such as members and equipment. We query it to gain beautiful insights that will help arrive at data-driven decisions.

It's sourced from https://github.com/AshwanthSai/ who remarkably organized and cleaned it.

Go through the script to see how we arrived at answers to the questions below:

1. Retrieve the names of all fire stations along with their respective locations and operation types.

2. List all incidents that occurred in urban areas, including their types, descriptions, and locations.
